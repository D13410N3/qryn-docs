## Motivation
##### 🧠🤯🎱 = 💵 ?

Most cloud observability platforms _include a free headache_ in the pricing model. 

Assuming they do support _logs, metrics and tracing_ in a single service, most tend to rate each typology in a different way, forcing specific agent or formats on users and sometimes they make things _overly complex_ to plan and forecast. Once you figure out the pricing model, the majority of service result _crazy expensive_. Other _"dirt cheap"_ tracing platforms appear to operate without any regard for EU/US privacy laws, backups, security and compliance. _A guaranteed recipe for disaster._

_*We wanted our service to be a solution, rather than another puzzle to crack.*_

With **Gigapipe**, we can operate [qryn](https://qryn.dev) as a _state-of-the-art affordable service._
