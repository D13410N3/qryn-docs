# Querying

In this section, we'll learn how to find and query our ingested data. Let's get __qryn__!


### Explore

In order to explore our logs and metrics, we'll need to use a _client_ such as _Grafana_

<!-- tabs:start -->
#### ** Grafana **
?> Explore using [grafana](guide/datasources.md) and its _amazing visualizations_
#### ** View **
?> Explore using [qryn-view](view.md) our embedded user interface
#### ** vLogQL ***
?> Explore using a command line client such as [vLogQL](https://github.com/lmangani/vlogql)
