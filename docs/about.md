Started in 2018 as a _proof-of-concept_ to demonstrate the vast capabilities of Clickhouse, it evolved through covid times 2020-2022 into an solid, fully featured polyglot stack for real-life workloads, leveraging the _lightness_ of NodeJS for its API and the _raw power_ of Clickhouse to perform heavy-duty tasks. In 2023 qryn became part of the [Gigapipe](https://gigapipe.com) group powering the [qryn.cloud](https://qryn.cloud) observability service alongside dedicated licensing and support options for large scale deployments and commercial partner integrations.
