# About 

**qryn** _(formerly known as cLoki)_ is a project incubated at _qxip_ built by _ClickHouse users_ for _ClickHouse users_.

?> It's pronounced /Ààkw…™r..…™≈ã/ or _querying_

Started in 2018 as a _proof-of-concept_ to demonstrate the vast capabilities of Clickhouse, it evolved through covid times 2020-2022 into an solid, fully featured polyglot stack for real-life workloads, leveraging the _lightness_ of NodeJS for its API and the _raw power_ of Clickhouse to perform heavy-duty tasks. For large scale deployments and cloud service integrations, the qryn:cloud stack is available for licensing.
