# About 

**qryn** _(formerly known as cLoki)_ is a project incubated at _qxip_ built by _ClickHouse users_ for _ClickHouse users_.

?> It's pronounced /ˈkwɪr..ɪŋ/ or _querying_

Started in 2018 as a _proof-of-concept_ artwork to display the vast capabilities of Clickhouse, it evolved through Covid times 2020-2022 into an fully featured stack for real-life workloads, leveraging the _lightness_ of NodeJS for its API and the _raw power_ of Clickhouse to perform heavy-duty tasks.

- 📦 A _high-performance_ version of qryn developed in go is separately available for [integrator licensing](mailto:info@qxip.net).
